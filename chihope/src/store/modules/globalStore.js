The placebo-controlled CMAP trial (NCT02121717, ClinicalTrials.gov) included 350 patients randomly assigned to receive low dose (32 mg/day, n = 106), high dose (48 mg/day, n = 106) insulin sensitizer and placebo (n = 138) for treatment. The sitagliptin-controlled CMAS trial (NCT02173457, ClinicalTrials.gov) included 485 patients randomly assigned to receive low dose (n = 161), high dose (n = 161) insulin sensitizer and sitagliptin (n = 163) for treatment.'
